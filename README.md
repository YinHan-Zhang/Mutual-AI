## Sloving Problems:
1. The problem of the dry and boring theoretical knowledge in the learning process of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the current field of artificial intelligence.
2. The "black box problem" encountered by novices in the hands-on learning process.

## Things We are doing :

1. To increase the fun of learning AI, we have searched for many interesting and easy-to-use projects with online demonstration experiences.
2. To solve the "black box problem", we provide detailed explanations of the implementation principles of the projects, helping novices to quickly learn and understand.
